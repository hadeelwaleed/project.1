       <p class="tow">In 1911, Picasso's first trip was to Paris, the art capital in Europe, and there he met for the first time his friend, the French poet and journalist Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn French and French literature, and soon they moved to live together in a small room where Jacob slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night, and he had many times suffered from poverty, despair, and cold, to the point that many of his works burned them to keep the room warm. During the first five months in 1901, Picasso returned to live again in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francesco Soler founded the magazine "Young Art", which published five issues, in which Soler wrote articles while Picasso contributed to the cartoons, most of which were the caricature in which Picasso depicted the suffering. the poor. The first issue of this magazine was published on March 31, 1901, at which time Picasso began to sign the name "Picasso" after he had, throughout his previous years, signed his works using the name "Pablo Ruiz Picasso"</p>
